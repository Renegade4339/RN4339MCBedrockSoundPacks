# RN4339MCBedrockSoundPacks

Hello, it's been a while since I suddenly disappeared from GitHub for a while. I decided to come 
back to here to rather not (re)release an HDest addon, but instead to release all of my 
resource packs for Minecraft Bedrock, so here they are so far:

> HDestSounds

The first sound and primary pack that I made and still use in any occasion. The pack focuses on combat-based sound events, especially on, getting hit. Sounds are from id Software for Doom, 3477 (Matt) for Hideous Destructor, Yholl for a soundpack addon for HDest, and Raven Software for Hexen.


> AmongMurderMystery[1]

Second sound pack that I made and the first sound pack I made exclusively for The Hive's Murder Mystery. I had this joke about among us sounds in Murder Mystery, and thank god for the roles update in Among Us. In short, started as a joke idea, ended up into a serious resource pack. Sounds are from Innersloth from Among Us.


> HDestDeathMessages

Sequel to HDestSounds, except full of death messages this time. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to give translations over the death messages. Death messages strings are from 3477 for HDest, Graf Zahl for GZDoom and made some from myself.


> HEVFlatlineSound

A byproduct from an update for HDestSounds, usage of a fan expansion of the classic textures, and me having ideas from Half-Life. Plays a flatline when you die, so to speak. Flatline sounds from Valve Corporation.


> ImmerseMurderMystery[1]

Lore, lore, and more lore. Second sound pack exclusive for The Hive. Makes things in MM a make a little more sense. Credits in the resource pack files.


>CyberdemonSounds

hehehe...
i binge on hdestifying the wardens to hdest, so i made this.


>HDestSounds PSX Edition 

Basically the same as HDestSounds but with the sounds from PS1 Doom/Doom 64. From id Software, Raven Software, Matt, Aubrey Hodges, Jaxxoon R, DeXiaZ, and SCD.


>ZFootstepsMC

footstep replacement sounds from the footsteps addon for zdoom. 'nuff said. From The Zombie Killer and Ral22.


>Rene's Combat Texture Pack

self-explanatory. Commissioned by gabixPHpear. Full credits in the credits file for the mod.


>UNDERTALEsp

A remake of my old sound pack since 2020.
WARNING: IT HAS LOUD SOUNDS (PARTICULARLY THE EXPLOSION AND LIGHTNING IMPACT SOUNDS), SO BE WARNED.


> Quake Jumping Sounds

A silly sound pack I made so that every time you jump, your character will say "HUUH". Best paired
when playing with QuakeCraft. REQUIRES HDESTSOUNDS OR HDESTSOUNDSPSX 1.4.2 OR HIGHER.


> DOOM 64 Music Pack

A music pack that replaces the vanilla tracks with ones from DOOM 64 (along with fanmade ones
with the same ambient style). Credits inside the .mcpack file.


[1] - SIDENOTE ON USING ANY PACK HAVING THIS NOTE: Please deactivate the pack should you decided to hop off from Murder Mystery since MM uses most sound events from Vanilla Minecraft.

Full credits in the primary credits file.
